## Setup

Maybe in more detail... nothing fancy you could follow the tutorials for setting up each of these,
copy my dots, and you should be good to go :)

## Credits

Some of my dotfiles are actually bits and bobs from other people that I tweaked
into something I like. The majority of the theming comes from [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin)
which is a wonderful theme and community. My Sketchybar configuration is a slight variation
on [the owner's setup](https://github.com/FelixKratz/dotfiles/). My Starship configuration is
a patched variation on [rxyhn's](https://github.com/rxyhn) config that I cannot find the source
for anymore (help!).
